Some intermediate files are stored in a dropbox folder. If necessary the can be obtained through a public link or by request to ferninfm@gmail.com

The project has three main folders.
Dataset: contains an R rpository and .txt files which contain the complete summary dataset.
Process: Contains the workflows used in parallel during the analysis of the data organised numerically. Branching is then repressenting by adding A,B,C to the end of each step.
Final report: Contains the supplementary material, especially a latex file with embeded R code that can be processed using knitr to a pdf file (also provided)

Good luck and thanks for all the fungi
